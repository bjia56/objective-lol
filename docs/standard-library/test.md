# TEST Module - Testing and Assertions

The TEST module provides testing functionality for verifying program behavior and creating test suites.

## Importing TEST Module

```lol
BTW Import entire module
I CAN HAS TEST?

BTW Selective import
I CAN HAS ASSERT FROM TEST?
```

## ASSERT Function

The ASSERT function verifies that a condition is true and throws an exception if it's false. This is the primary testing tool for validating program behavior.

### Syntax

```lol
ASSERT WIT <condition>
```

**Parameters:**
- **condition**: Any type - The condition to test for truthiness

**Behavior:**
- If condition is truthy: Function returns normally
- If condition is falsy: Throws "Assertion failed" exception

### Truthiness Rules

The ASSERT function uses Objective-LOL's truthiness rules:

| Type | Falsy Values | Truthy Values |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `BOOL` | `NO` | `YEZ` |
| `INTEGR` | `0` | Any non-zero number |
| `DUBBLE` | `0.0` | Any non-zero number |
| `STRIN` | `""` (empty string) | Any non-empty string |
| `NOTHIN` | Always falsy | Never truthy |
| Objects | Never falsy | Always truthy |

## Basic Testing Examples

### Simple Assertions

```lol
I CAN HAS TEST?
I CAN HAS STDIO?

## Error Handling in Tests

### Exception Testing

```lol
I CAN HAS TEST?
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_EXPECTED_EXCEPTION
    SAYZ WIT "=== Testing Expected Exceptions ==="
    
    BTW Test that division by zero throws an exception

    ASSERT WIT EXCEPTION_THROWN
    SAYZ WIT "‚úì Division by zero correctly threw exception"
    
    BTW Test that normal division doesn't throw
    EXCEPTION_THROWN ITZ NO
    
    MAYB
        I HAS A VARIABLE RESULT TEH DUBBLE ITZ 10.0 DIVIDEZ 2.0
        ASSERT WIT RESULT SAEM AS 5.0

    OOPSIE UNEXPECTED_ERROR
        SAYZ WIT "‚ùå Unexpected error in normal division"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

## Quick Reference

### ASSERT Function

| Function | Parameters | Behavior |
|----------|------------|----------|
| `ASSERT WIT condition` | condition: Any type | Throws "Assertion failed" if condition is falsy |

### Truthiness Reference

| Value | Truthiness |
|-------|------------|
| `YEZ` | Truthy |
| `NO` | Falsy |
| Non-zero numbers | Truthy |
| `0` or `0.0` | Falsy |
| Non-empty strings | Truthy |
| `""` | Falsy |
| `NOTHIN` | Falsy |
| Objects | Truthy |

### Common Test Patterns

```lol
BTW Basic assertion
ASSERT WIT ACTUAL SAEM AS EXPECTED

BTW Testing for inequality
ASSERT WIT ACTUAL SAEM AS EXPECTED SAEM AS NO

BTW Testing ranges
ASSERT WIT VALUE BIGGR THAN MIN_VALUE
ASSERT WIT VALUE SMALLR THAN MAX_VALUE

BTW Testing collections
ASSERT WIT ARRAY SIZ SAEM AS EXPECTED_SIZE
ASSERT WIT MAP DO CONTAINS WIT "key"

BTW Testing exceptions
MAYB
    RISKY_OPERATION
    ASSERT WIT NO  BTW Should not reach here
OOPSIE EXPECTED_ERROR
    BTW Exception was thrown as expected
    ASSERT WIT YEZ
