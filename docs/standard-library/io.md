## Io Interfaces

### READER Class

Abstract base class for objects that can read data.
Defines the interface for reading operations with READ and CLOSE methods.

**Methods:**

#### CLOSE

Closes the reader and releases any associated resources.
Should be called when done reading to ensure proper cleanup.

**Syntax:** `<reader> DO CLOSE`
**Example: Basic cleanup**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE READER TEH READER ITZ GET_FILE_READER
I HAS A VARIABLE DATA TEH STRIN ITZ READER DO READ WIT 1024
WHILE NO SAEM AS (DATA LENGTH SAEM AS 0)
PROCESS_DATA WIT DATA
DATA ITZ READER DO READ WIT 1024
KTHX
READER DO CLOSE
SAYZ WIT "Reader closed successfully"
```

**Example: Close in error handling**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE READER TEH READER ITZ GET_NETWORK_READER
MAYB
I HAS A VARIABLE DATA TEH STRIN ITZ READER DO READ WIT 512
PROCESS_DATA WIT DATA
OOPSIE ERR
SAYZ WIT "Error during processing: "
SAYZ WIT ERR
READER DO CLOSE
KTHX
```

**Example: Multiple readers cleanup**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE READERS TEH BUKKIT ITZ NEW BUKKIT
READERS DO PUSH WIT GET_FILE_READER_1
READERS DO PUSH WIT GET_FILE_READER_2
READERS DO PUSH WIT GET_FILE_READER_3
WHILE NO SAEM AS (READERS LENGTH SAEM AS 0)
I HAS A VARIABLE READER TEH READER ITZ READERS DO POP
I HAS A VARIABLE DATA TEH STRIN ITZ READER DO READ WIT 1024
WHILE NO SAEM AS (DATA LENGTH SAEM AS 0)
PROCESS_DATA WIT DATA
DATA ITZ READER DO READ WIT 1024
KTHX
READER DO CLOSE
KTHX
SAYZ WIT "All readers closed"
```

**Example: Close with resource tracking**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE READER TEH READER ITZ GET_DATABASE_READER
I HAS A VARIABLE RESOURCE_COUNT TEH INTEGR ITZ 1
MAYB
I HAS A VARIABLE DATA TEH STRIN ITZ READER DO READ WIT 2048
WHILE NO SAEM AS (DATA LENGTH SAEM AS 0)
SAVE_TO_DATABASE WIT DATA
DATA ITZ READER DO READ WIT 2048
KTHX
OOPSIE ERR
SAYZ WIT "Database operation failed: "
SAYZ WIT ERR
KTHX
RESOURCE_COUNT ITZ RESOURCE_COUNT MINUS 1
READER DO CLOSE
SAYZ WIT "Resources remaining: "
SAYZ WIT RESOURCE_COUNT
```

**Note:** Always call CLOSE to prevent resource leaks

**Note:** CLOSE should be called even if errors occur during reading

**Note:** Multiple CLOSE calls should be safe (idempotent)

**Note:** CLOSE may flush buffers or finalize operations

**Note:** After CLOSE, further READ operations may fail

#### READ

Reads up to the specified number of characters from the input source.
Returns empty string when end-of-file is reached.

**Syntax:** `<reader> DO READ WIT <size>`
**Parameters:**
- `size` (INTEGR): Maximum number of characters to read

**Example: Read fixed-size chunks**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE READER TEH READER ITZ GET_FILE_READER
I HAS A VARIABLE CHUNK_SIZE TEH INTEGR ITZ 1024
I HAS A VARIABLE DATA TEH STRIN ITZ READER DO READ WIT CHUNK_SIZE
WHILE NO SAEM AS (DATA LENGTH SAEM AS 0)
SAYZ WIT "Read chunk of length: "
SAYZ WIT DATA LENGTH
DATA ITZ READER DO READ WIT CHUNK_SIZE
KTHX
READER DO CLOSE
```

**Example: Read single character at a time**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE READER TEH READER ITZ GET_INPUT_READER
I HAS A VARIABLE CHAR TEH STRIN ITZ READER DO READ WIT 1
WHILE NO SAEM AS (CHAR LENGTH SAEM AS 0)
SAYZ WIT "Character: "
SAYZ WIT CHAR
CHAR ITZ READER DO READ WIT 1
KTHX
READER DO CLOSE
```

**Example: Handle end-of-file**

```lol

SAYZ WIT DATA
KTHX
READER DO CLOSE
```

**Example: Read with size validation**

```lol

SAYZ WIT "Error: Read more than requested"
NOPE
SAYZ WIT "Successfully read "
SAYZ WIT DATA LENGTH
SAYZ WIT " characters"
KTHX
KTHX
READER DO CLOSE
```

**Note:** May return fewer characters than requested

**Note:** Returns empty string when end-of-file is reached

**Note:** Size must be a positive integer

**Note:** Implementation depends on the concrete reader type

### BUFFERED_WRITER Class

Buffered writer that wraps another WRITER object for improved performance.
Reduces the number of actual I/O operations by buffering data internally.

**Methods:**

#### BUFFERED_WRITER

Initializes a BUFFERED_WRITER with the given WRITER object.
Default buffer size is 1024.

**Syntax:** `NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT <writer>`
**Parameters:**
- `writer` (WRITER): The underlying writer to wrap with buffering

**Example: Basic construction**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE BASE_WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_FILE_WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT BASE_WRITER
SAYZ WIT "Buffered writer created with default buffer size"
```

**Example: Construction with immediate use**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT GET_NETWORK_WRITER
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Hello from buffered writer!"
BUFFERED DO CLOSE
SAYZ WIT "Data written through buffered writer"
```

**Example: Construction for different writer types**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE TYPES TEH BUKKIT ITZ NEW BUKKIT
TYPES DO PUSH WIT "file"
TYPES DO PUSH WIT "network"
TYPES DO PUSH WIT "console"
WHILE NO SAEM AS (TYPES LENGTH SAEM AS 0)
I HAS A VARIABLE TYPE TEH STRIN ITZ TYPES DO POP
I HAS A VARIABLE WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_WRITER_BY_TYPE WIT TYPE
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
SAYZ WIT "Created buffered writer for type: "
SAYZ WIT TYPE

KTHX
```

**Example: Construction with error handling**

```lol
MAYB
I HAS A VARIABLE WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_SOME_WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
SAYZ WIT "Buffered writer created successfully"
OOPSIE ERR
SAYZ WIT "Failed to create buffered writer: "
SAYZ WIT ERR
KTHX
```

**Note:** Default buffer size is 1024 characters

**Note:** Buffer size can be changed after construction using SIZ

**Note:** The underlying writer is not closed when buffered writer is closed

**Note:** Buffered writer takes ownership of the underlying writer

#### CLOSE

Closes the buffered writer and the underlying WRITER.
Flushes any remaining buffered data before closing.

**Syntax:** `<buffered_writer> DO CLOSE`
**Example: Basic cleanup with auto-flush**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_FILE_WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Final data"
BUFFERED DO CLOSE
SAYZ WIT "Buffered writer closed - data auto-flushed"
```

I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Incomplete"
BUFFERED DO CLOSE
SAYZ WIT "Partial buffer data flushed during close"
```

**Note:** Automatically flushes any remaining buffered data

**Note:** Closes both the buffered writer and underlying writer

**Note:** Releases all associated resources

**Note:** Safe to call multiple times (idempotent)

**Note:** After CLOSE, further WRITE operations will fail

**Note:** Ensures underlying writer is properly closed

#### FLUSH

Flushes the internal buffer to the underlying WRITER.
Should be called to ensure all buffered data is written out.

**Syntax:** `<buffered_writer> DO FLUSH`
**Example: Explicit flushing for immediate writes**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_LOG_WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Important log message"
BUFFERED DO FLUSH
SAYZ WIT "Log message written immediately"
```

I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Data to flush"
MAYB
BUFFERED DO FLUSH
SAYZ WIT "Data flushed successfully"
OOPSIE ERR
SAYZ WIT "Error during flush: "
SAYZ WIT ERR
KTHX
BUFFERED DO CLOSE
```

**Example: Flush with empty buffer**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_FILE_WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
BUFFERED DO FLUSH
SAYZ WIT "Flush on empty buffer - no operation performed"
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Some data"
BUFFERED DO FLUSH
SAYZ WIT "Data flushed after writing"
BUFFERED DO CLOSE
```

**Example: Multiple flushes in sequence**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_CONSOLE_WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "First "
BUFFERED DO FLUSH
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Second "
BUFFERED DO FLUSH
BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Third"
BUFFERED DO FLUSH
SAYZ WIT "All parts written incrementally"
BUFFERED DO CLOSE
```

**Note:** Forces immediate writing of all buffered data

**Note:** Does not affect buffer size or configuration

**Note:** Safe to call on empty buffer (no operation)

**Note:** Can be called multiple times safely

**Note:** Useful for ensuring data reaches destination immediately

**Note:** May improve responsiveness for interactive applications

#### WRITE

Writes string data to the buffered writer.
Data is buffered internally and flushed to the underlying WRITER when the buffer is full or when FLUSH/CLOSE is called.
Returns the number of characters written.

**Syntax:** `<buffered_writer> DO WRITE WIT <data>`
**Parameters:**
- `data` (STRIN): String data to write

**Example: Basic buffered writing**

```lol
I HAS A VARIABLE WRITER TEH WRITER ITZ GET_FILE_WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE BUFFERED TEH BUFFERED_WRITER ITZ NEW BUFFERED_WRITER WIT WRITER
I HAS A VARIABLE CHARS_WRITTEN TEH INTEGR ITZ BUFFERED DO WRITE WIT "Hello World"
SAYZ WIT "Wrote "
SAYZ WIT CHARS_WRITTEN

```

**Note:** Data is buffered until buffer is full or FLUSH/CLOSE is called

**Note:** Large data may be written directly bypassing the buffer

**Note:** Returns the number of characters actually written

**Note:** Buffer size affects when data is automatically flushed

**Note:** May return fewer characters if error occurs during writing

**Member Variables:**

#### SIZ

Gets or sets the size of the internal buffer used for writing.
Setting a new size will drop the existing buffer.
Default is 1024. Must be a positive integer.

**Note:** Default buffer size is 1024 characters

**Note:** Setting new size drops existing buffer contents

**Note:** Must be a positive integer greater than 0

**Note:** Larger buffers reduce I/O calls but use more memory

**Note:** Smaller buffers flush more frequently

**Note:** Can be changed at any time during writer lifetime
