# File Processing Examples

Real-world examples of file processing, text manipulation, and data handling using Objective-LOL's FILE module and standard library.

## Prerequisites

These examples use the following modules:
- `FILE` - File operations
- `STDIO` - Console I/O
- `STRING` - String manipulation
- `MATH` - Mathematical operations

## Basic File Operations

### Reading and Writing Text Files

```lol
I CAN HAS FILE?
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN CREATE_SAMPLE_FILE
    SAYZ WIT "Creating sample data file..."

    I HAS A VARIABLE DOC TEH DOCUMENT ITZ NEW DOCUMENT WIT "sample_data.txt" AN WIT "W"
    DOC DO OPEN

    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Name: Alice Johnson\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Age: 28\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Department: Engineering\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Salary: 75000\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "---\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Name: Bob Smith\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Age: 34\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Department: Marketing\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "Salary: 68000\n"
    DOC DO WRITE WIT "---\n"
