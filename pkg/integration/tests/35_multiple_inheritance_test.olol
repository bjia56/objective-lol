BTW Test: Multiple inheritance with KITTEH OF FOO AN OF BAR syntax
BTW Expected Output:
BTW Drawing something
BTW Moving somewhere  
BTW Sprite updated
BTW Flying through the air
BTW Giving birth to live young
BTW Screech!
BTW MRO Test: BAT, MAMMAL, FLYING, ANIMAL
BTW Base class method

I CAN HAS SAYZ FROM STDIO?

BTW Base interfaces for multiple inheritance
HAI ME TEH CLAS DRAWABLE
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN DRAW
        SAYZ WIT "Drawing something"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

HAI ME TEH CLAS MOVABLE  
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN MOVE
        SAYZ WIT "Moving somewhere"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

BTW Multiple inheritance example
HAI ME TEH CLAS SPRITE KITTEH OF DRAWABLE AN OF MOVABLE
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN UPDATE
        DIS DO DRAW
        DIS DO MOVE
        SAYZ WIT "Sprite updated"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

BTW Diamond inheritance pattern test
HAI ME TEH CLAS ANIMAL
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH VARIABLE NAME TEH STRIN ITZ "Unknown"
    
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN MAKE_SOUND
        SAYZ WIT "Generic animal sound"
    KTHX
    
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN BASE_METHOD
        SAYZ WIT "Base class method"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

HAI ME TEH CLAS MAMMAL KITTEH OF ANIMAL
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN GIVE_BIRTH
        SAYZ WIT "Giving birth to live young"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

HAI ME TEH CLAS FLYING KITTEH OF ANIMAL
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN FLY
        SAYZ WIT "Flying through the air"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

BTW Diamond inheritance resolved with C3 linearization
BTW MRO should be: BAT, MAMMAL, FLYING, ANIMAL
HAI ME TEH CLAS BAT KITTEH OF MAMMAL AN OF FLYING
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN MAKE_SOUND
        SAYZ WIT "Screech!"  BTW Overrides ANIMAL.MAKE_SOUND
    KTHX
    
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_MRO
        SAYZ WIT "MRO Test: BAT, MAMMAL, FLYING, ANIMAL"
    KTHX
KTHXBAI

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    BTW Test basic multiple inheritance
    I HAS A VARIABLE SPRITE_OBJ TEH SPRITE ITZ NEW SPRITE
    SPRITE_OBJ DO UPDATE
    
    BTW Test diamond inheritance
    I HAS A VARIABLE BAT_OBJ TEH BAT ITZ NEW BAT
    BAT_OBJ DO FLY            BTW From FLYING
    BAT_OBJ DO GIVE_BIRTH     BTW From MAMMAL  
    BAT_OBJ DO MAKE_SOUND     BTW From BAT (overridden)
    BAT_OBJ DO TEST_MRO       BTW From BAT
    BAT_OBJ DO BASE_METHOD    BTW From ANIMAL (via MRO)
KTHXBAI
