BTW Parentheses support test
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    SAYZ WIT "=== Parentheses Support Test ==="

    BTW Setup test variables
    I HAS A VARIABLE AA TEH INTEGR ITZ 5
    I HAS A VARIABLE BB TEH INTEGR ITZ 3
    I HAS A VARIABLE CC TEH INTEGR ITZ 2
    I HAS A VARIABLE DD TEH INTEGR ITZ 4

    BTW Test basic parentheses
    SAYZ WIT "Basic parentheses:"
    SAY WIT "(5 + 3) = "
    SAYZ WIT (AA MOAR BB)

    SAY WIT "(5 - 3) = "
    SAYZ WIT (AA LES BB)

    BTW Test precedence override
    SAYZ WIT "Precedence override:"
    SAY WIT "2 * 3 + 4 = "
    SAYZ WIT CC TIEMZ BB MOAR DD

    SAY WIT "2 * (3 + 4) = "
    SAYZ WIT CC TIEMZ (BB MOAR DD)

    SAY WIT "(2 + 3) * 4 = "
    SAYZ WIT (CC MOAR BB) TIEMZ DD

    BTW Test nested parentheses
    SAYZ WIT "Nested parentheses:"
    SAY WIT "((5 + 3) - 2) = "
    SAYZ WIT ((AA MOAR BB) LES CC)

    SAY WIT "(5 + (3 * 2)) = "
    SAYZ WIT (AA MOAR (BB TIEMZ CC))

    SAY WIT "((2 + 3) * (4 - 2)) = "
    SAYZ WIT ((CC MOAR BB) TIEMZ (DD LES CC))

    BTW Test complex expressions
    SAYZ WIT "Complex expressions:"
    SAY WIT "(5 + 3) * 2 - (4 / 2) = "
    SAYZ WIT (AA MOAR BB) TIEMZ CC LES (DD DIVIDEZ CC)

    SAY WIT "((5 - 3) + 2) * (4 - 2) = "
    SAYZ WIT ((AA LES BB) MOAR CC) TIEMZ (DD LES CC)

    BTW Test with double values
    I HAS A VARIABLE E TEH DUBBLE ITZ 2.5
    I HAS A VARIABLE F TEH DUBBLE ITZ 1.5
    SAYZ WIT "With double values:"
    SAY WIT "(2.5 + 1.5) * 2 = "
    SAYZ WIT (E MOAR F) TIEMZ CC

    BTW Test with comparisons and logical operators
    SAYZ WIT "With comparisons and logical:"
    SAY WIT "(5 > 3) AN (2 < 4) = "
    SAYZ WIT (AA BIGGR THAN BB) AN (CC SMALLR THAN DD)

    SAY WIT "(5 < 3) OR (2 = 2) = "
    SAYZ WIT (AA SMALLR THAN BB) OR (CC SAEM AS CC)

    SAYZ WIT "=== Parentheses Support Test Complete ==="
