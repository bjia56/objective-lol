BTW Test basic UDP socket functionality
I CAN HAS SOCKET?
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_UDP_SOCKET_CREATION
    SAYZ WIT "Testing UDP socket creation..."
    
    BTW Create UDP socket
    I HAS A VARIABLE SERVER TEH SOKKIT ITZ NEW SOKKIT
    SERVER PROTOCOL ITZ "UDP"
    SERVER HOST ITZ "localhost"
    SERVER PORT ITZ 9877
    
    SAYZ WIT "Socket created with protocol:"
    SAYZ WIT SERVER PROTOCOL
    SAYZ WIT "Host:"

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_UDP_BIND_AND_CLOSE
