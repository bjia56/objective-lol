BTW Arithmetic operations test
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    SAYZ WIT "=== Arithmetic Operations Test ==="

    BTW Setup test variables
    I HAS A VARIABLE AA TEH INTEGR ITZ 15
    I HAS A VARIABLE BB TEH INTEGR ITZ 3
    I HAS A VARIABLE CC TEH DUBBLE ITZ -2.5
    I HAS A VARIABLE DD TEH DUBBLE ITZ 1.5

    BTW Test integer arithmetic
    SAYZ WIT "Integer arithmetic:"
    SAY WIT "15 + 3 = "
    SAYZ WIT AA MOAR BB

    SAY WIT "15 - 3 = "
    SAYZ WIT AA LES BB

    SAY WIT "15 * 3 = "
    SAYZ WIT AA TIEMZ BB

    SAY WIT "15 / 3 = "
    SAYZ WIT AA DIVIDEZ BB

    BTW Test double arithmetic
    SAYZ WIT "Double arithmetic:"
    SAY WIT "-2.5 + 1.5 = "
    SAYZ WIT CC MOAR DD

    SAY WIT "-2.5 - 1.5 = "
    SAYZ WIT CC LES DD

    SAY WIT "-2.5 * 1.5 = "
    SAYZ WIT CC TIEMZ DD

    SAY WIT "-2.5 / 1.5 = "
    SAYZ WIT CC DIVIDEZ DD

    BTW Test mixed arithmetic
    SAYZ WIT "Mixed arithmetic:"
    SAY WIT "15 + -2.5 = "
    SAYZ WIT AA MOAR CC

    BTW Test special bases
    SAYZ WIT "Special base arithmetic:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE HEXA TEH INTEGR ITZ 0xA
    I HAS A VARIABLE OCTA TEH INTEGR ITZ 0o12
    SAY WIT "0xA + 0o12 = "
    SAYZ WIT HEXA MOAR OCTA

    SAYZ WIT "=== Arithmetic Operations Test Complete ==="
