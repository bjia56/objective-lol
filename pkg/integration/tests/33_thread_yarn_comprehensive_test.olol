I CAN HAS THREAD?
I CAN HAS STDIO?
I CAN HAS TIME?

BTW Define a custom thread class that extends YARN
HAI ME TEH CLAS WORKER KITTEH OF YARN
    EVRYONE
    DIS TEH VARIABLE TASK_NAME TEH STRIN ITZ "Default Task"
    DIS TEH VARIABLE COMPLETED_TASK TEH STRIN ITZ "Not Started"

    BTW Constructor for WORKER
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN WORKER WIT NAME TEH STRIN
        YARN
        TASK_NAME ITZ NAME
    KTHX

    BTW Override the abstract SPIN method
    DIS TEH FUNCSHUN SPIN
        SLEEP WIT 2
        BTW Simulate thread work by updating the completed task
        COMPLETED_TASK ITZ "Future Built Successfully"
        GIVEZ UP
