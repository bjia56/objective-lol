BTW Comparison operators test
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    SAYZ WIT "=== Comparison Operations Test ==="

    BTW Setup test variables
    I HAS A VARIABLE W TEH INTEGR ITZ 10
    I HAS A VARIABLE X TEH INTEGR ITZ 5
    I HAS A VARIABLE Y TEH INTEGR ITZ 10
    I HAS A VARIABLE Z TEH DUBBLE ITZ 10.0

    BTW Test greater than
    SAYZ WIT "Greater than comparisons:"
    SAYZ WIT "10 > 5:"
    SAYZ WIT W BIGGR THAN X

    SAYZ WIT "5 > 10:"
    SAYZ WIT X BIGGR THAN W

    BTW Test less than
    SAYZ WIT "Less than comparisons:"
    SAYZ WIT "5 < 10:"
    SAYZ WIT X SMALLR THAN W

    SAYZ WIT "10 < 5:"
    SAYZ WIT W SMALLR THAN X

    BTW Test equality
    SAYZ WIT "Equality comparisons:"
    SAYZ WIT "10 == 10:"
    SAYZ WIT W SAEM AS Y

    SAYZ WIT "10 == 5:"
    SAYZ WIT W SAEM AS X

    SAYZ WIT "10 == 10.0:"
    SAYZ WIT W SAEM AS Z

    BTW Test string comparisons
    I HAS A VARIABLE STR1 TEH STRIN ITZ "hello"
    I HAS A VARIABLE STR2 TEH STRIN ITZ "hello"
    I HAS A VARIABLE STR3 TEH STRIN ITZ "world"

    SAYZ WIT "String equality:"
    SAYZ WIT "hello == hello:"
    SAYZ WIT STR1 SAEM AS STR2

    SAYZ WIT "hello == world:"
    SAYZ WIT STR1 SAEM AS STR3

    BTW Test boolean comparisons
    I HAS A VARIABLE TRUE1 TEH BOOL ITZ YEZ
    I HAS A VARIABLE TRUE2 TEH BOOL ITZ YEZ
    I HAS A VARIABLE FALSE1 TEH BOOL ITZ NO

    SAYZ WIT "Boolean equality:"
    SAYZ WIT "YEZ == YEZ:"
    SAYZ WIT TRUE1 SAEM AS TRUE2

    SAYZ WIT "YEZ == NO:"
    SAYZ WIT TRUE1 SAEM AS FALSE1

    SAYZ WIT "=== Comparison Operations Test Complete ==="
