BTW Comparison operators test
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    VISIBLEZ WIT "=== Comparison Operations Test ==="

    BTW Setup test variables
    I HAS A VARIABLE W TEH INTEGR ITZ 10
    I HAS A VARIABLE X TEH INTEGR ITZ 5
    I HAS A VARIABLE Y TEH INTEGR ITZ 10
    I HAS A VARIABLE Z TEH DUBBLE ITZ 10.0

    BTW Test greater than
    VISIBLEZ WIT "Greater than comparisons:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT "10 > 5:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT W BIGGR THAN X

    VISIBLEZ WIT "5 > 10:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT X BIGGR THAN W

    BTW Test less than
    VISIBLEZ WIT "Less than comparisons:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT "5 < 10:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT X SMALLR THAN W

    VISIBLEZ WIT "10 < 5:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT W SMALLR THAN X

    BTW Test equality
    VISIBLEZ WIT "Equality comparisons:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT "10 == 10:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT W SAEM AS Y

    VISIBLEZ WIT "10 == 5:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT W SAEM AS X

    VISIBLEZ WIT "10 == 10.0:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT W SAEM AS Z

    BTW Test string comparisons
    I HAS A VARIABLE STR1 TEH STRIN ITZ "hello"
    I HAS A VARIABLE STR2 TEH STRIN ITZ "hello"
    I HAS A VARIABLE STR3 TEH STRIN ITZ "world"

    VISIBLEZ WIT "String equality:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT "hello == hello:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT STR1 SAEM AS STR2

    VISIBLEZ WIT "hello == world:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT STR1 SAEM AS STR3

    BTW Test boolean comparisons
    I HAS A VARIABLE TRUE1 TEH BOOL ITZ YEZ
    I HAS A VARIABLE TRUE2 TEH BOOL ITZ YEZ
    I HAS A VARIABLE FALSE1 TEH BOOL ITZ NO

    VISIBLEZ WIT "Boolean equality:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT "YEZ == YEZ:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT TRUE1 SAEM AS TRUE2

    VISIBLEZ WIT "YEZ == NO:"
    VISIBLEZ WIT TRUE1 SAEM AS FALSE1
