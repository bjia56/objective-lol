BTW Standard library time functions test
I CAN HAS STDIO?
I CAN HAS TIME?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    SAYZ WIT "=== Time Library Test ==="

    BTW Test current time functions
    SAYZ WIT "Current date/time information:"
    SAY WIT "Current year: "
    SAYZ WIT YEAR
    SAY WIT "Current month: "
    SAYZ WIT MONTH
    SAY WIT "Current day: "
    SAYZ WIT DAY

    SAYZ WIT "Current time:"
    SAY WIT "Hour: "
    SAYZ WIT HOUR
    SAY WIT "Minute: "
    SAYZ WIT MINUTE
    SAY WIT "Second: "
    SAYZ WIT SECOND

    BTW Test timestamp functions
    SAYZ WIT "Timestamp information:"
    SAY WIT "Current Unix timestamp (seconds): "
    I HAS A VARIABLE TIMESTAMP TEH INTEGR ITZ NOW
    SAYZ WIT TIMESTAMP

    SAY WIT "Current timestamp (milliseconds): "
    I HAS A VARIABLE MILLIS_TIME TEH INTEGR ITZ MILLIS
    SAYZ WIT MILLIS_TIME

    BTW Test time formatting
    SAYZ WIT "Formatted time:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE FORMATTED TEH STRIN ITZ FORMAT_TIME WIT TIMESTAMP AN WIT "2006-01-02 15:04:05"
    SAY WIT "ISO format: "
    SAYZ WIT FORMATTED

    BTW Test sleep function (brief sleep to avoid long test)
    SAYZ WIT "Testing sleep (2 seconds)..."
    I HAS A VARIABLE BEFORE_SLEEP TEH INTEGR ITZ SECOND
    SLEEP WIT 2
    I HAS A VARIABLE AFTER_SLEEP TEH INTEGR ITZ SECOND
    SAY WIT "Sleep completed. Before: "
    SAYZ WIT BEFORE_SLEEP
    SAY WIT "After: "
    SAYZ WIT AFTER_SLEEP

    BTW Test time calculations
    SAYZ WIT "Time calculations:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE CURRENT_YEAR TEH INTEGR ITZ YEAR
    I HAS A VARIABLE BIRTH_YEAR TEH INTEGR ITZ 1990
    I HAS A VARIABLE AGE TEH INTEGR ITZ CURRENT_YEAR LES BIRTH_YEAR
    SAY WIT "If born in 1990, current age would be approximately: "
    SAYZ WIT AGE

    BTW Test multiple timestamp calls
    SAYZ WIT "Multiple timestamp calls:"
    SAY WIT "First call: "
    SAYZ WIT NOW
    SAY WIT "Second call: "
    SAYZ WIT NOW
    SAY WIT "Third call: "
    SAYZ WIT NOW

    BTW Test different format patterns
    SAYZ WIT "Different time formats:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE FORMAT1 TEH STRIN ITZ FORMAT_TIME WIT TIMESTAMP AN WIT "2006/01/02"
    I HAS A VARIABLE FORMAT2 TEH STRIN ITZ FORMAT_TIME WIT TIMESTAMP AN WIT "15:04:05"
    I HAS A VARIABLE FORMAT3 TEH STRIN ITZ FORMAT_TIME WIT TIMESTAMP AN WIT "Jan 02, 2006"

    SAY WIT "Date only: "
    SAYZ WIT FORMAT1
    SAY WIT "Time only: "
    SAYZ WIT FORMAT2
    SAY WIT "Readable format: "
    SAYZ WIT FORMAT3

    BTW Test edge cases
    SAYZ WIT "Testing historical timestamp:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE OLD_TIMESTAMP TEH INTEGR ITZ 0
    I HAS A VARIABLE OLD_FORMATTED TEH STRIN ITZ FORMAT_TIME WIT OLD_TIMESTAMP AN WIT "2006-01-02 15:04:05"
    SAY WIT "Unix epoch (1970-01-01): "
    SAYZ WIT OLD_FORMATTED
