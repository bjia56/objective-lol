BTW Control flow structures test
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    SAYZ WIT "=== Control Flow Test ==="

    BTW Test basic if statement
    I HAS A VARIABLE X TEH INTEGR ITZ 10

    SAYZ WIT "Testing if X > 5:"
    IZ X BIGGR THAN 5?
        SAYZ WIT "X is greater than 5!"
    KTHX

    BTW Test if-else statement
    SAYZ WIT "Testing if X > 20:"
    IZ X BIGGR THAN 20?
        SAYZ WIT "X is greater than 20!"
    NOPE
        SAYZ WIT "X is not greater than 20!"
    KTHX

    BTW Test while loop
    SAYZ WIT "Counting down from 5:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE COUNTER TEH INTEGR ITZ 5
    WHILE COUNTER BIGGR THAN 0
        SAYZ WIT COUNTER
        COUNTER ITZ COUNTER LES 1
    KTHX

    BTW Test nested control structures
    SAYZ WIT "Testing nested structures:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE II TEH INTEGR ITZ 1
    WHILE II SMALLR THAN 4
        SAY WIT "Outer loop: "
        SAYZ WIT II

        IZ II SAEM AS 2?
            SAYZ WIT "  Found number 2!"
        NOPE
            SAYZ WIT "  Not number 2"
        KTHX

        II ITZ II MOAR 1
    KTHX

    BTW Test complex conditions
    I HAS A VARIABLE AA TEH INTEGR ITZ 5
    I HAS A VARIABLE BB TEH INTEGR ITZ 10
    I HAS A VARIABLE CC TEH INTEGR ITZ 15

    SAYZ WIT "Testing complex condition:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE FIRST_TEST TEH BOOL ITZ AA SMALLR THAN BB
    I HAS A VARIABLE SECOND_TEST TEH BOOL ITZ BB SMALLR THAN CC
    IZ FIRST_TEST AN SECOND_TEST?
        SAYZ WIT "A < B < C is true!"
    KTHX

    SAYZ WIT "=== Control Flow Test Complete ==="
