BTW Test module import scoping - imports are scoped to their function
BTW This test demonstrates function-scoped imports

BTW Function that imports STDIO locally
HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_LOCAL_STDIO_IMPORT
    I CAN HAS STDIO?
    VISIBLEZ WIT "STDIO imported and used locally in this function"
KTHXBAI

BTW Function that imports MATH locally
HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_LOCAL_MATH_IMPORT
    I CAN HAS MATH?
    I HAS A VARIABLE RESULT TEH DUBBLE ITZ ABS WIT -42.5
    BTW Note: This function cannot use VISIBLEZ because STDIO is not imported here
    BTW VISIBLEZ WIT "This would fail - no STDIO here"
KTHXBAI

BTW Function that imports both STDIO and TIEM locally
HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_MULTIPLE_LOCAL_IMPORTS
    I CAN HAS STDIO?
    I CAN HAS TIEM?
    VISIBLEZ WIT "Testing multiple local imports:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE CURRENT_YEAR TEH INTEGR ITZ YEAR
    VISIBLE WIT "Current year: "
    VISIBLEZ WIT CURRENT_YEAR
KTHXBAI

BTW Function that has no imports - cannot use any stdlib functions
HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN TEST_NO_IMPORTS
    BTW Cannot use VISIBLEZ, ABS, YEAR, etc. without importing
    BTW VISIBLEZ WIT "This would fail"
    I HAS A VARIABLE X TEH INTEGR ITZ 42
    BTW Can only use basic language features
KTHXBAI

BTW Main function with its own import
HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    I CAN HAS STDIO?
    VISIBLEZ WIT "=== Function-Scoped Import Test ==="

    BTW Each function has its own import scope
    TEST_LOCAL_STDIO_IMPORT
    TEST_LOCAL_MATH_IMPORT
    TEST_MULTIPLE_LOCAL_IMPORTS
    TEST_NO_IMPORTS

    BTW MAIN can only use what it imported (STDIO in this case)
    VISIBLEZ WIT "MAIN can use STDIO because it imported it"
    BTW But MAIN cannot use MATH functions without importing
    BTW I HAS A VARIABLE MATH_RESULT TEH DUBBLE ITZ ABS WIT -5.0  BTW This would fail

    VISIBLEZ WIT "=== Function-scoped imports working correctly ==="
KTHXBAI
