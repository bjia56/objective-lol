BTW Logical operations test
I CAN HAS STDIO?

HAI ME TEH FUNCSHUN MAIN
    SAYZ WIT "=== Logical Operations Test ==="

    BTW Setup boolean variables
    I HAS A VARIABLE TRUE_VAL TEH BOOL ITZ YEZ
    I HAS A VARIABLE FALSE_VAL TEH BOOL ITZ NO

    BTW Test AND operation
    SAYZ WIT "AND operations:"
    SAY WIT "YEZ AN YEZ: "
    SAYZ WIT TRUE_VAL AN TRUE_VAL

    SAY WIT "YEZ AN NO: "
    SAYZ WIT TRUE_VAL AN FALSE_VAL

    SAY WIT "NO AN YEZ: "
    SAYZ WIT FALSE_VAL AN TRUE_VAL

    SAY WIT "NO AN NO: "
    SAYZ WIT FALSE_VAL AN FALSE_VAL

    BTW Test OR operation
    SAYZ WIT "OR operations:"
    SAY WIT "YEZ OR YEZ: "
    SAYZ WIT TRUE_VAL OR TRUE_VAL

    SAY WIT "YEZ OR NO: "
    SAYZ WIT TRUE_VAL OR FALSE_VAL

    SAY WIT "NO OR YEZ: "
    SAYZ WIT FALSE_VAL OR TRUE_VAL

    SAY WIT "NO OR NO: "
    SAYZ WIT FALSE_VAL OR FALSE_VAL

    BTW Test complex logical expressions
    SAYZ WIT "Complex expressions:"
    I HAS A VARIABLE AA TEH INTEGR ITZ 5
    I HAS A VARIABLE BB TEH INTEGR ITZ 10
    I HAS A VARIABLE CC TEH INTEGR ITZ 15

    SAY WIT "(5 < 10) AND (10 < 15): "
    I HAS A VARIABLE FIRST_COMP TEH BOOL ITZ AA SMALLR THAN BB
    I HAS A VARIABLE SECOND_COMP TEH BOOL ITZ BB SMALLR THAN CC
    SAYZ WIT FIRST_COMP AN SECOND_COMP

    SAY WIT "(5 > 10) OR (10 < 15): "
    I HAS A VARIABLE THIRD_COMP TEH BOOL ITZ AA BIGGR THAN BB
    I HAS A VARIABLE FOURTH_COMP TEH BOOL ITZ BB SMALLR THAN CC
    SAYZ WIT THIRD_COMP OR FOURTH_COMP
